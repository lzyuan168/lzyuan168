## Personal Profile

I am a Master’s graduate from Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence, majoring in Machine Learning. I have worked on a number of deep learning projects both for my Bachelor’s dissertation as well as a six months long industrial attachment internship. I have also gained much more experience through multiple deep learning projects during my Master’s degree, such as [Covid-19 Fake News Detection](https://github.com/lzyuan168/fake_news_detection) NLP project, [Stress Detection](https://github.com/lzyuan168/stress_detection_through_ood) using Conventional Machine Learning, [Violence and Weaponized Violence Detection](https://github.com/lzyuan168/Violence_Detection) using Energy Efficient Deep Neural Networks and [Emotion Detection in Video Conferencing Applications](https://github.com/lzyuan168/Emotion-Recognition). My Master's thesis is utilizing End-to-end Deep Neural Network for [Multimodal Biometric Authentication and Driver Stress Detection](https://github.com/lzyuan168/multimodal_biometric_authentication).
